# React Web Portfolio

The task is to create a portfolio using React, which will help set me apart from other developers. Deploy the app using GitHub pages.

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples, SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer, WHEN I load the portfolio, THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.
2. WHEN I view the header, THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
3. WHEN I view the navigation titles, THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.
4. WHEN I click on a navigation title, THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.
5. WHEN I load the portfolio the first time, THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default.
6. WHEN I am presented with the About Me section, THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.
7. WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section, THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.
8. WHEN I am presented with the Contact section, THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.
9. WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text,, THEN I receive a notification that this field is required.
10. WHEN I enter text into the email address field, THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.
11. WHEN I am presented with the Resume section, THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
12. WHEN I view the footer, THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
